My Order Of Operations For Making A Set

This article outlines my process for making custom magic sets.

I will be using Errors in the Weft (ERR) as an example since it's the set I spent the most time on. 

Some notes:
- I assuming you are designing a set for both draft and a constructed format. If you only care about limited, you might want to make a cube instead. If you only care about constructed, you might want to make a rarityless set or precon.
- There are many ways to make a set; I am by no means the most experienced designer in the community. This is but one solution.

Step 1: Raison D'Etre

- Very short description of the set's identity
- Must include both a flavour and mechanical component
- Will be a guiding principle for future design decisions
- For flavour and tone, reference works can be useful

Step 2: Art Hunting

- Art hunting takes a while and I'm not great at it
- I recommend Artstation
- Good to start early so you know what veins are deep and what are sparse
- And because art tuns over over time
- Need about 400 total, so start early

Step 3: Mechanics

- Refer to that one excellent article
- Also makes sure to have different types of mechanics on the taxonomy to spread out design space
- Mechanics are the most constrained part of design, so important to do this first 

Step 4: Archetypes and Themes

- Why do sets have 2-color archetypes
- 1: Give drafters direction
- 2: Give set identity to inspire and justify designs
- 3: Make things easier to remember

A good archetype
- Is a functional deck
- It is clear what cards go in it
- It has cards that it wants more than other decks

- The most common mistake I see is archetypes without mechanics or mechanics without raison d'etre

Step 5: Commons

- Common extended skeleton
- 4 to 1 ratio
- Start with the most constrained slots first

Step 6: Uncommons

- Similar extended skeleton
- As, Bs, and Cs

Step 7: Rares

- These will happen naturally
- Constructed requirements

Step 8: Iteration

-  The longest part
