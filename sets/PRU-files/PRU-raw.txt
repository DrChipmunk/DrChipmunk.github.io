Perennial Ultimatum: A set designed for draft

Perennial Ultimatum is structured like a modern standard-legal draft set, and the levels of power, speed, synergy, and complexity are comparable or slightly higher.
<Besiege>

The range of card power is narrower; rares have higher ceilings than commons or uncommons, but require specific situations or deliberate deck building to reach that peak.
<Erode Fate>

Mana fixing is plentiful, but two-colour decks, often with a splash, are the norm.
<Salted Barrens>

This set is based on a tabletop RPG campaign that I ran about the magical land of Faerie, the humans that found and conquered it, and how its residents pushed them back.
<November, Firestarter>

A set designed excusively for limited players

- follow the normal rules of a design skeleton
- keep aggro in check by limiting early aggression, while keeping the early turns relevant
- no massive power outliers, positive or negative
- emphasize pools of synergy rather than rigid archetypes
- no shuffling or planeswalkers
- reduce wordiness whenever possible

Tokens:
1/1 white Human
1/1 red Cat
2/2 green Fungus Elemental
2/2 blue Illusion with flying
X/X colorless Construct artifact creature
Copy
Basic Land
Treasure

This card = Sprout (time spiral)

4 person draft
180 draftable cards
20 tactic cards
100 basic lands
18 tokens
total:
280 sleeves of colour A
38 sleeves of colour B
double this for an 8-player draft
Fully decked cube for 8-person play = 3(4?) of each common, 2 of each uncommon, 1 of each rare/mythic = 303+160+53+15=521, plus 200 basics, 36 tokens, 40 tactics
Collation process for 8 players: separate the commons by colour. From each colour, deal one card to each of the 24 packs, then 15 to the mess. From the lands and artifacts, deal one to each of the packs and 44 to the mess. Add one random card of any colour to the mess. Take the 120 cards of the mess and deal 5 of them to each pack.
