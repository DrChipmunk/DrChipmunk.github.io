Could be 3/1 w/ +2/+4 or 2/2 w/ +4/+4 or 3 to activate\n\nChanged since June\n\nAn odd card. By stats alone, this might be the best common 2-srop in the set (or maybe it\u2019s the Unicorn). Want this to occupy the Basking Rootwalla / Wary Thespian spot of a 2-drop that\u2019s better later.\n\nMaybe 2/2 with a Rootwalla ability +1/+1 for each Human / cheaper for each Human / activate only if you have a Human?\n\nConsider 2/2 w/ 3G: CARDNAME gets +3/+3 until end of turn. Activate only once each turn and only if you control a Human.\n\nWouldn\u2019t sneeze at 2G to activate\n\nnew design. 3/1?", "image_type": "png"}
