If you only care about limited, you might want to make a cube instead. If you only care about constructed, you might want to make a rarityless set or precon. There are many ways to make a set; I am by no means the most experienced designer in the community. This is but one solution.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Step 1: Raison D'Etre</b><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Before any cards get made, it's important to ask: Why are you making this set? Are you making it for a specific format or play group? WIll it be played online, or printed out, or just a display piece? Errors in the Weft was designed explicitly for Revolution Custom Standard, which narrowed certain decisions.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Beyond that, what makes this set different from other sets? A flavour description and sense of tone is useful here, but getting deep into worldbuilding at this stage is ill-advised since mechanical and art-hunting considerations will dictate a lot of what is possible. Unless you're hitting a really deep vein of flavour space, you should also have a mechanical identity. For example, this might be a mechanic you want to explore, a style of gameplay you like, or an unusual set structure you want to experiment with. ERR started with the flavourful pitch of \"A failing digital utopia\" and a mechanical pitch of \"big creatures matter\".<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It's worth taking some time here to get these right since they'll be a guiding principle for future design decisions. For describing flavour and tone, I've found listing three existing works of fiction that mark the boundaries of your thematic space to be useful: for ERR these were 17776, Twilight Mirage, and Transistor.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Step 2: Art Hunting</b><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Art hunting is the longest and to me, the hardest part of design. You'll need to do a lot of it, so start early. As in, before you design any cards early. There are some designers that are very good at art hunting; I'm not one of them. I usually go to Artstation and start searching keywords that mgiht connect to what I want. For ERR I started searching \"extreme\" and \"cyber\" and \"solarpunk\"; you'll need ot think creatively as the low-hanging fruit is exhausted. When you see something you like, save it, and go through the rest of that artist's portfolio and save all the other good-looking stuff as well.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You should start art hunting at this stage not just because it will take a long time but because what you can and can't art-hunt will inform your worldbuilding and design. ERR got a lot of bikers in part because they kept showing up in my searches; meanwhile some other ideas I just couldn't art and so were abandoned. Art also turns over in time, so spreading out your art hunt over months makes it easier. You'll need about 400 pieces minimum, so get started.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Step 3: Mechanics</b><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Designing mechanics is the most contrained part of design. There are a lot of great mechanics still out there but they're a lot sparser on the ground than good card designs. A typical set has 3-5 major mechanics.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You want mechanics focused in a variety of colors (ideally, each color should have at least one mechanic that is heavily focused in that color). You want mechanics that can go on creatures and on noncreatures. You want mechanics that can play different roles in your set structure (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BlG7fajvnBgdbypDq1bqM0iCqDeE-Jo9XTfkdr8CqjA is an excellent article on this). You want mechanics of a variety of implementations (for example, if you have three mechanics that are all \"whenever <thing happens>, <variable effect>\", you'll quickly run out of repeatable triggers that make sense at common. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zBMvmzgxIKdDxtRntJQrr8-GYAIJICIU7SHsspWp3sI is a guide to the different mechanic varieties). You want your mechanics to support your mechanical identity and to play well - or at least not poorly - together.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;ERR ended up with Subroutines (subtype, splash), Cache (keyword action, grease), Level Up (activated ability, combat / grease), Fabric (variable, demand), and Corrupt (threshold, demand).<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Step 4: Archetypes and Themes</b><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The way that wizards presents the structure of their sets is through 2-color archetypes. It's a good system, but shouldn't be followed blindly. 2-color archetypes are by no means the only way to organize a set, but they do a few nice things. They give drafters - especially drafters unfamiliar with your set - direction by giving them a clear synergy axis to build around. This makes them more likely to end up with a functional, interesting deck. Archetypes also give your set identity to inspire and justify designs. For example, the BG theme in ERR is \"creatures and enchantments in graveyard\". By having cards that count the number of creatures and enchantments in your yard instead of just creatures, otherwise normal effects can be made to feel like they belong. Archetypes are mainly relevant for limited but they can often inform constructed design as well.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A good 2-color archetype is not just a shared line of text; it's a functional deck with a gameplan. It should be clear which cards are meant for which archetype; these are signposts meant to guide players through your set - don't be subtle. Importantly, each archetype should have cards that it is interested in that other decks aren't. For example, \"RW Aggro\" is a bad archetype because the cards an aggro deck wants - cheap creatures, combat tricks - are also valuable to other limited decks.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Step 5: Commons</b><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Some people do the gold uncommons (arcuns) first but I do them after commons; that's personal preference. Commons have a lot of roles to fill. You can't really design them one at a time. To start on designing commons, I start by laying out the skeleton (Maro's nuts and bolts articles have a good starting skeleton). So for white, that might look like<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1x 1-mana creature. 2x 2-mana creature. 2x 3-mana creature. 2x 4-mana creature. 1x 5-mana creature. 3x removal spell. 1x combat trick. 1x other. (ERR has a higher curve and higher removal density for battlecruiser reasons. It also has only 13 commons per color because there are hybrid commons).<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There are certain requirements expected of every set. For white, those are about<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;flying x3, vigilance x1, artifact / enchantment interaction x1, lifegain x1<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And then there are requirements from your themes and mechanics.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Subroutine x2, landcycling x1, cache x2, level up x2, fabric x1, enchantments x4, level up matters x1, blink / self-bounce spell x1, go-wide payoff x1. (If you want a mechanic to be an all-color mechanic, you need at least one common in each color. A good rule of thumb for mechanics / archetypes that have enablers and payoffs is that you need four common enablers for each common payoff. Look at similar mechanics / archetypes in canon sets to see how many commons you need)<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You may notice that these requirements add up to a lot more than 13. So most commons are going to have to fulfill multiple roles. That's good - it restricts and inspires your design. Start with the mechanics and archetypes thath are going to be the hardest to design for. For ERR, that's the Subroutines. Whenever possible, try to check off as many requirements as possible with the simplest card possible - meeting all requirements with the lowest total complexity is the goal.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Step 6: Uncommons</b><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Canon sets these days have 10 or 20 gold uncommons (arcuns) that strongly signal their archetype. Usually, do those before the other uncommons. At this point it's a good idea to start thinking about archetype curves. For example, if your GW enchantment deck has a common 4-drop payoff, 3-drop payoff, and 7-drop payoff, the gold uncommons should include a 2-drop and maybe a 5-drop. Arcuns should above all else not be subtle. A player should take one look at them and have an idea of exactly what cards would work with it.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After you have the commons done, or when you have a few uncommons, it's a good time to start playtesting. Common and uncommon drafts, pre-built draft-ish decks, jumpstart: these are all good ways to get rough and fast playtesting impressions. Playtest early and often, against yourself if necessary.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You can do the same extended skeleton used for commons for uncommons, but the requirements are less strict. I like to break down uncommons into three categories of roughly equal size. Type A uncommons are straightforwardly powerful, desired by many decks, and serve as constructed plants and signals of open colors. Pushed 1-for-1 interaction is a classic here, as is cheap threats and generic two-for-ones. Type B uncommons are strong signals to a specific deck; often \"secret gold cards\". There should be at least one for each of the four archetypes that touch each color. Type C uncommons are the rest; sideboard cards, weird constructed plants; sideways build-arounds; cool but not super powerful designs.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Step 7: Rares (and Mythics)</b><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Rares are my weakest type of design so I can offer only limited advice. In the course of designing commons and uncommons you'll surely have ideas too complex, game-warping, or powerful for those rarities. Those can start your rare files. Otherwise, rares should explore the more unusual implementations of your mechanics, be high-ceiling low-floor payoffs for all-in decks, target specific constructed niches, contain effects that warp entire games around them, etc.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Step 8: Iteration</b><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Congratulations! You have a completed set file. You have now begun making a set. Most of design is re-design, and turning your first draft into something finished will take a lot of iteration.

She pulled into the long, shallow curve ahead, low on all fours. She dug the wheeled blades on her feet into the tiles in a few pushing strides, then settling them straight behind her and letting the motors do the work. She was picking up speed.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She leaned gently into the turn, leading with the matching wheels attached to her forearms. The Grip\u2019s oxygen-rich air whipped by her. The joints in the tiles jostled her bones. She could feel it in her teeth. She cut within centimeters of the turn\u2019s inside corner as it transitioned into the next sector. Nine hundredths ahead now.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Ahead, the track banked up into a long, curved wallride section made of transparent plastic. Xeia took the ramp into it, coasting on the near-vertical surface, held up by the wall\u2019s curve and her own speed. The Grip stretched out below her, a tangle of arenas, tracks, and stunt parks. Her motors squealed, threatening to lose traction. She shifted down a gear and angled them up, giving them more bite.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;On the other side of this clean plastic wall was a rock-climbing course. A man with holographic green hair was going for an acrobatic jump, carrying momentum to swing from one leap into the next. The Downlink connected them as they flew past. Wordless props flowed between them. She didn\u2019t need to look back to know he made the jump.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As the wallride flattened out again, Xeia watched for a pattern on the track\u2019s faux-sand texture. The area was darkened by skid marks from her past attempts, but she wouldn\u2019t be able to rely on those in the race. She lifted her arm blades and slammed them back into the track at a harsh angle. Her armblades whipped to the side, redirected in an instant and carrying her with them. She pushed off with her coiled legs for a final boost.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She sailed through empty space. She could feel her wonder reflected in the Downlink, echoing through the whole Weft, felt as a faint glimmer of adrenaline by a hundred thousand minds, and coming back to her. They were pretty sure she\u2019d land it.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She did. She cut off the feeling of collective relief coming in, disconnecting from the Downlink drifting into the final downhill. The landing wasn\u2019t fully clean, only three hundredths ahead now. She eyed the spot for an early jump on the last corner. Her high-bite blades, built for turning, not speed, hummed a rising drone. She leaned down, bringing her arms close together in front of her to slice through the air. She could hear her own heartbeat. She went for it.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Xeia sailed through the air alone. The far surface of the curve crept up in her vision.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Xeia instinctively braced her arm blades in front of her, moments before she hit the ledge. She fell, gathering speed through the open air. She reset her splits; another failed run on the day. Stretching her arms to both sides slowed the spin. The ground rushed up to meet her.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A quarter-pipe, bare grey untextured surface, popped into existence in her way. She braced herself and hit it hard, sprawling down the ramp and onto solid, flat ground. She reactivated her Downlink connection, letting her pain dissipate through the network. She opened her eyes and saw a woman leaning over her.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Her bulky, toned muscles were visible beneath her dark red tracksuit. Both this and her sleek, geometric helmet were traced by white lines of light. Similar braided cords of light spilled from the helmet\u2019s back.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Xeia pulled herself back up to her feet, despawning her blades.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cI could have caught myself\u201d, she said. She took the woman\u2019s outstretched hand and used it to haul herself onto her feet.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cSure you could.\u201d A stabbing pain in Xeia\u2019s side made her stagger to the side. The bigger woman caught her. \u201cYou should get yourself to a reju-tube.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cNo shit\u201d, said Xeia. She shifted out of her lanky, light racing body and into something more suited to walking. Torn ligaments and muscles returned to data, but the ache of wrenching forces still ingered.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cThere\u2019s a couple tubes at A9, I can walk you there. I was going there anyways\u201d, she said. She gestured to the track with the arm that wasn\u2019t holding Xeia up. \u201cHeck of a pace you were on. Training for the season closer?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Xeia nodded.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cSaw you on the track last race, but didn\u2019t get you on the Downlink\u201d, she said. \u201cName\u2019s Queenside Knight, or you can call me Q. Got a team going, we\u2019re sharing strats. You should join.\u201d An invite flickered into Xeia\u2019s vision.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She dismissed it. She paused on the edge of A9 skate park, pushing herself off Queenside\u2019s shoulder and finding her balance in the unfamiliar posture of standing.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cYou got a private link you\u2019re on?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cNope. It\u2019s a challenge I\u2019m doing. Best possible season placement with no Downlink connection.\u201d Xeia lowered herself down the steps one at a time. Skaters weaved around her.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cHadn\u2019t heard of this one. Is it new this season?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cNot a public thing.\u201d Two person-sized tubes of transparent, viscous liquid stood side-by-side as the park\u2019s central obstacle. \u201cJust something for myself.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Xeia grabbed the outside handle and heaved herself into the rejuvenation pod. The cool gel conformed around her body. She leaned her head back and let herself float. The system worked from the legs up, leaving her briefly with the alien sensation of having no legs at all. When they returned, they were tender. They jolted with electricity as she moved them again.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Queenside was talking to her, leaning against her tube.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201c- crazy thing to do, Downlink\u2019s such a big part of this league, especially with the fan work. You in on this?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Xeia bobbed.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cBunch of people in the stands running sims, finding the optimal lines. Live during the race, just going off whatever the leader\u2019s uploading. Total game-changer. Got us the last three side events. I don\u2019t offer spots to just anyone.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Xeia relaxed her shoulders, feeling them dissolve into points of light and restitch from the bottom up. A skater did a kickflip off the tube\u2019s glass. Through the gel it felt like a rumbling wave. She was feeling well enough to speak a few words at Queenside before her head became light.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cNot interested, Q\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Xeia cricked her neck back and forth a few times, feeling out her sore muscles. The pod door opened and she dismounted.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Queenside stood in front of her. \u201cYou\u2019re a good racer, Xeia\u201d, she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re handicapping yourself. You\u2019d have a shot at the win - heck, winning the whole season - if you\u2019d let it go.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cWhat makes you so sure your way is better?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Queenside scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me. I\u2019ve got a server with five champion fourblade runners figuring this out and you think you can do better on your own.\u201d Queenside produced a baton of light. Characters scrolled along its side.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cHere. It\u2019s a pseudonymous uplink. My team\u2019s using it to connect during races. In case you change your mind.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Xeia stared at it for a moment, before snatching it out of Queenside\u2019s hand and stashing it in a pocket. She scowled, turned, and summoned a hoverboard under her feet. She tuned down her audio input before Queenside could respond. The hoverboard lifted off, carrying her out into empty Grip space. She pulled a Downlink ID she hadn\u2019t used in a while to the front of her memory and made a call.<br><br><hr><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Xeia left the Spine at 3A8 and walked into the buffer. This entrance passed through a humid greenhouse; daemons in the form of holographic butterflies flocked around her as she passed. It opened up onto a cobbled street lit in greens and blues by a perpetual sunset. Idle chatter and wine was on the air. Xeia was dressed for the region, taller than her racing form in a turquoise dress that flared out into a skirt of living leaves. At the edge of town, over the buildings, she could see the Skyline Caf\u00e9, her destination. It was a ferris wheel outlined in spindly silver filigree, carrying cars like mismatched teacups.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When Xeia left the lift to the cab with a single table for two, Airiva was already there. She stashed the holographic mannequin suspended in the air in front of her, stood, and greeted Xeia with a hug.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cXeia! It\u2019s been an age since I last saw you.\u201d Standing, Airiva was even taller than Xeia. Her daring purple dress exposed the diagonal cross-sections of her torso, arms, and legs that were made of deep blue translucent crystal.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve been on the track.\u201d Xeia took her seat.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Airiva leaned back in hers. Her outfit shifted into her old racing stripes. \u201cGood times\u201d, she said. She shifted back into the dress. \u201cI must admit I was surprised to receive your call. What is this about?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Xeia perused the menu inset into the porcelain table. \u201cI can\u2019t just call up an old friend for a nice meal?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cNo. No you can\u2019t.\u201d Airiva swiped in her selections. The menus receded into the table. \u201dIf you\u2019re here, Xeia, you want something. And if it\u2019s me in particular you want, it must have something to do with fourblade racing. Let me guess, you want me back on the track?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A plate of palm-sized crackers shaped like snowflakes with accompanying lemon and rosemary dips phased up through the table. \u201cMaybe. You got anything more urgent you\u2019re doing?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Airiva beamed. \u201cI\u2019m working on a whole line of avatars and avatar accessories, based around an oceanic theme. Some cutting-edge work with boids algorithms\u201d She leaned forward, positioning her face in front of Xeia\u2019s. \u201cLet me show you.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Airiva\u2019s body became a swarm of flat, metallic, fish-shaped creatures. They expanded out from her body, then settled into a flowing swarm. Despite the constant movement, her wry smile and high cheekbones were clearly recognizeable. Her dress became a frothy waterfall, cascading down her body like a sash.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There was a soft ding, giving Xeia a reason to stop staring. A chef in an impeccable tuxedo appeared at the edge of the room, holding in his hand a glass dome containing a swirling lavender-tinted mist.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cIs there a prize you\u2019re gunning for with that look?\u201d Xeia waved a cracker in Airiva\u2019s general direction. Air whistled through the gaps in the snowflake pattern in a harmonious chime.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cA grip kid at heart. No, there\u2019s no prize, but any artist wants to see their work appreciated. The Mirage Exposition is coming up, and it\u2019s a show which often shapes trends for the next season.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The chef lifted the cloche, allowing the mist to spill off the table and fill the air in a fragrant marbled display of shapes of purple, revealing two fillets of fish on a black plate. They both applauded appropriately.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Airiva drew a pair of wine glasses out of the table\u2019s surface and passed one to Xeia. \u201cSo, not urgent per se, but I\u2019m happy in the buffer for the time being.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cOh, you wouldn\u2019t need to leave the buffer.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Airiva raised a crystalline eyebrow.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cI\u2019ll need you on wheels just once, for a few minutes, on a night a few days from now.\u201d Xeia poured a golden sauce onto her fish from a porcelain dish. It sizzled and cracked as it landed.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Airiva leaned back in her chair, gazing into the dissipating fog. \u201cI have a counter-offer\u201d, she said.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cI\u2019m listening\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cI join another of your harebrained schemes\u2026\u201d Airiva paused to take a sip of wine \u201c... and in exchange, you model for me at the Mirage Exposition. I think my work could benefit from an athlete\u2019s poise.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Xeia took another mouthful of fish. She put one elbow on the table and rested her chin on her hand for a moment. \u201cDeal.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cAre we finally done with business, then?\u201d said Airiva. She hovered her palm over the cab\u2019s do-not-disturb interface.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cSounds like we are.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The cab\u2019s glass roof shimmered into an opaque pearl.<br><br><hr><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The track had been fitted with a podium and finish line for the day. Flocks of people stood on personal hovering glass platforms, crowding around the racetrack. The Grip\u2019s normally bright sunlight had been dimmed for the event, allowing the neon signs on arenas and restaurants to illuminate passersby in saturated colour. The racers were lined up, hands down and feet to their starting blocks. Xeia flicked a switch by her ear, deafening the anticipation running through her body as she completely disconnected from the Downlink.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She felt the starting countdown as a bass shudder through the track. Three, two, one. The starting blocks exploded into colour, propelling the racers forward. Xeia lowered her body a hand\u2019s breadth from the track to avoid getting airtime. She pushed down into the track. She could hear the clatter of another set of wheels just to her right.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She was following her practiced route. A straightaway; her motors whined and the racer in front of her drifted away from her. A corner; she sprayed up sparks, taking a sharper line that bought her the space back again.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Queenside Knight was in the lead, her light-fibre hair whipping to the side with every turn. The track evened out into a shallow curve. Xeia could see Queenside pull her limbs in tight, putting one arm in front of the other. With her four blades in a straight line, she barely cleared a tight wall on her left and then her right. That was new.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Xeia took the turn as she was used to, weaving through the flow of competitors following Queenside\u2019s line. At least two must have passed her there.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She was middle of the pack coming into the wallride. The climbing wall on the outside of the transparent tiles had been replaced with stadium seating. Spectators popped in as the racers arrived. Their cheering was tinny and soft against the roaring wind in Xeia\u2019s ears.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She aimed for the familiar line. Timing her breath, she slammed her arms down into the drift, nearly clipping the arms of the racer behind her as she snapped sharply to the side, off the side of the track and into empty air. No one followed her. The crowd parted around her like a school of fish. She landed clean with nothing but open track in front of her.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When she dropped into the final sector, she could hear another drop briefly behind. Maybe half a second gap. She pushed off with a foot, then settled into a sleek figure to pick up speed. She felt a ridge in the track in her bones, followed by another clack. Three tenths now.<br><br><hr><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Queenside Knight was impressed. The cut on the wallride exit wasn\u2019t a new idea, but with all the downsides of high-grip on this track she\u2019d never seriously considered it. The whir of her wheels tuned up in pitch. She was gaining on Xeia, each slaloming turn bringing her closer to the sparks off her foot-blades.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Ten-odd uplinks rested at the back of her mind. Each turn was followed by a cascade of similar sensations from the racers following her. Together they locked in their technique, gaining speed in the downhill. Just one-tenth now.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She could feel a new uplink, leading her movements instead of lagging them. She pulled in to the front. She recognized the ID and smiled. The uplink had Xeia\u2019s signature heavy, industrial armblades, and it was digging into the track, clawing its way forward. Queenside settled in, ready to make her move on the final jump.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The link cut a daring line, early off the bank to take a long jump, cutting the corner. Queenside followed, deep in the zone.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Wait a minute.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That line was tighter than any she\u2019d run in practice. The track pulled out to her side as she sailed uncontrollably through the air. The arms in the pseudonymous uplink lost their blades and became long and jewel-tinted, diving forward into a sunset-hued pool of water somewhere far away.<br><br><hr><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Xeia didn\u2019t look back as she heard the crash sirens behind her. Airiva had made good on her promise. She put the thought of time on the red carpet behind her. It would be fun, in its own way. She took the safest jump of her life coming into the final turn. She permitted herself to look up as the finish line approached, soaking in the applause.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A scream of liquid noise consumed Xeia\u2019s vision. The track, the finish line, the stands, all dissolved into a glitchy mass of red distortion. Her bones rattled and her blood yelled. She fell through the chaos, bracing for a ground she could not see.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She clicked her Downlink back on, unable to see her own arm but moving on instinct. Static poured over the connection. A burst of sound sent her into a spin. She couldn\u2019t tell if her eyes were open or closed. Pain, realer than anything, blossomed into the back of her skull.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Everything went grey.<br>", "story_title": "Weft Trace 01: The Record Chaser"}, {"card_name": "Lavis, Root Exec", "color": "WG", "rarity": "rare", "type": "Legendary Creature \u2013 Human Ranger", "number": 202, "color_identity": "WG", "cost": "{2}{G}{W}", "rules_text": "Vigilance, ward {1}\nWhenever Lavis attacks, sacrifice any number of artifacts and/or enchantments.

There was something wrong with them. The shadows were a custom shader they had written themself. They were meant to gather around the corners of the room, drenching the once-lively town square in darkness and drawing the eye to the great stone monument at its centre. Instead, the monument\u2019s surface was an angular mess of jet-black and flat grey that jittered with the slightest movement of Kaluthax\u2019s head.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A glimmering message daemon in the form of a tiny butterfly hovered next to their skull. \u201cIs it meant to look like that?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Kaluthax restarted the lighting in the area. For a moment, they hovered in a black void. When the light returned, it lurked and gloomed as it was supposed to. The inscription on the monument\u2019s surface was clearly visible as dark scars in the stone. \u201cBelow here lies the Palace of the Fool King, whose greed doomed us all. Do not venture there.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The voice on the line breathed in, showing an appropriate level of respect for Kaluthax\u2019s handiwork.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cSo\u201d, it said, \u201cHas anything else been glitching out on you? Any strange resource allocations, corruption of assets, anything like that?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A traveling shopkeeper in the Last Redoubt had been stuck walking in place for no apparent reason. One of the walls in the Maze of Darkness kept going missing. Just a few days ago they\u2019d lost contact with the entire Butcher\u2019s Quarter and had to restore it from a backup.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cNo\u201d, said Kaluthax.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cWell, just in case, we should get someone in here, make sure there\u2019s no memory leaks. From what I can tell, the Weave hasn\u2019t given this place a once-over in 65 years. Hey, is there anything under there?\u201d The butterfly cast a tiny mote of light at the plinth\u2019s bottom edge.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There, an area of skipping, fuzzy color was returning to the surface.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Kaluthax tapped the stones on the monument\u2019s side in a practiced pattern. The stone platform grumbled back, revealing a hidden staircase. They descended into the murky darkness.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The catacombs were barely recognizeable. Polygons on every surface had become ribbons of colour that stretched out to infinity. Whole segments of the wall blinked out of existence at the edges of Kaluthax\u2019s vision.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cDo not touch it. I will fix it myself\u201d, they said, letting some of the final-boss bass creep into their voice. They stepped out into the room and fell clean through the floor. They spawned in an untextured platform to catch themself, their head just barely peeking through the floor.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The butterfly zipped down to meet Kaluthax at eye level. \u201cLook, I get it, you\u2019ve got everything set up the way you want it, but I really think you should get someone in here. It could be an error.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Kaluthax rose gradually out of the floor.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cAnd if you don\u2019t want anyone from Weave or Element to do it, we could get someone from the Heap to take a look, maybe another dungeon master or someone who\u2019s run through this place before.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Kaluthax deleted the catacombs. The back sides of tunnels and treasures were visible, criss-crossing beneath them in the void.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cI have one more party in the dungeon. Once they\u2019re finished, I will be spending a few years in Archives and you can trash the place all you want.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The daemon took in the expanse of the dungeon below them. \u201cWill they be done soon?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Kaluthax pulled up an interface. \u201cThey will be done very soon, I think.\u201d<br><br><hr><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Astrius, daemonpriest, and Sylzar, stoneshaper, had made camp on a shadowy ledge overlooking the Palace of the Fool King. Sylzar was lying back on his bedroll as Astrius bound his bleeding leg. He was grinding a stone down into sand with his hands. His cowl and cloak hung by the fire, dripping a viscous green goo that sizzled as it hit the ground. A glowing holographic cat was draped over Astrius\u2019 shoulder, illuminating his work. Two more daemons stood watch, shedding their soft golden light down into the gloom.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cI guess there\u2019s nothing for it but to abandon the quest?\u201d said Astrius. He lowered Sylzar\u2019s leg onto the bedroll and stood back. \u201cWithout Castille, we\u2019ll have no one to stand guard for us against the Fool King and his pets. He was carrying most of our potions. The mantises have surely smashed or eaten them by now.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Sylzar balled his handful of sand back into a stone and threw it off the ledge. \u201cIt\u2019s been weeks in this dungeon and you\u2019re ready to bail now? This is the most exciting thing that\u2019s happened to us yet!\u201d He hauled himself onto his feet and started pacing. \u201cYeah, we don\u2019t have a tank anymore, and yeah, Zimis had all our stuff, \u2026\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cCastille\u201d, corrected Astrius.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cRight, character names, whatever.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Sylzar sculpted the stone of the balcony into a miniature model of the palace. \u201cAnyways, that\u2019s what makes this so cool. Despite all of that\u2013\u201d. He gestured to the hastily erected wall of stone that blocked the path behind them \u201c-- we still might be able to pull this one out. And if we die, it\u2019s no big deal. Your daemons back in the stack will survive without you for a few more hours.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Astrius turned away from him, holding one of his daemons tight to his chest. Sylzar\u2019s shouting echoed back from the cavern as a low rumble. A log in the campfire collapsed in, spreading a small shower of sparks.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Sylzar walked over and sat down beside him. \u201cSorry about that last one.\u201d He opened his arms. Astrius said nothing but allowed his daemon to jump into Sylzar\u2019s embrace.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cI just - I really think you should try to go through with this. Follow it through to the end. That\u2019s what\u2019s fun about heap dungeons: trying and failing and sometimes dying.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Astrius still didn\u2019t turn to face him, but nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d He packed the camp into his inventory with a meticulous spell. Sylzar stood and faced the palace\u2019s door. He spread his palms in a dramatic stance.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cLet\u2019s do this!\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The door of the Palace of the Fool King ground open.<br><br><hr><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Palace smelled of old blood. The light of the daemon striding ahead of the pair failed to illuminate the halls\u2019 dark corners. The echoes of their footsteps returned deeper and muffled. The entrance framed a massive statue of the king, its once-golden paint looted by doomed adventurers past.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They walked in silence. In the palace\u2019s dungeons, a deep, black mist swirled around their feet, and the daemon\u2019s normally steady light flickered and dimmed. Few monsters stood in their way as they descended, but Astrius did have to send daemons ahead to check for traps left by the paranoid king.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In the very depths of the castle the finery and grand windows gave way to wrought stone and iron bars. Sylzar had to meld the stone to open a path through a collapsed passageway. From ever further below, a deep grinding sound was becoming audible.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The passageway, now little more than a rough tunnel, opened up into a wide cavern. A massive shape loomed in the shadows. Astrius and Sylzar turned silently to each other and cast their buffs.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They walked into the room together. The shape stomped forward to meet them. It was a skeletal dragon; the king\u2019s finest creation. It spread its bony wings and emitted a guttural roar.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cDistract it!\u201d yelled Sylzar. He ran his hands into the room\u2019s edge. Tiny footholds sprung out from the stone. He climbed the wall, leaving Astrius to stare up at the dragon alone.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Astrius swallowed deeply. With a wave of his hand, three dragonfly-like daemons sprang forth and flew towards the dragon\u2019s skull. Astrius stood very still, motioning with his finger to project further beams of light around the room.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The dragon disintegrated a daemon with a flick of a claw and leveled its head towards Astrius. As the dragon reared back for a bite, Sylzar fell from the chamber\u2019s room onto its head, a spear of rough-hewn stone taller than himself in his hands. It went clear through the dragon\u2019s head, sending splinters of bone showering down.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The dragon reared back, throwing Sylzar off. Astrius dashed forwards, spawning a cloud of daemons to break Sylzar\u2019s fall. The dragon slashed Astrius as he ran with a massive claw. Astrius went flying.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He landed in a pool of spasming shadows. Jet-black triangles cut across his vision. All sound cut out from his left ear. He felt a deep, sickening, pain in his chest. He staggered to his feet, unable to see even his own hands. He scrambled out of the morass and looked back. The shadows were a human silhouette, moving in a stuttering gait across the room.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A skeletal figure in ornate, gilded robes walked through the wall. This was the Fool King of legend, reduced to a lich by his cruel experiments.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cYou need to get the hell out of here!\u201d he yelled. With a snap of his figures, the dragon blinked out of existence. With another, the misty ambiance was replaced by flat, white, sourceless lighting. The shadow remained, growing in stature in shuddering jolts.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cThis is out of character! The dungeon is closed! Go!\u201d He pointed to a wall, which immediately became a simple staircase leading down. \u201cMove!\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Astrius and Sylzar ran towards the exit bewildered. Kaluthax was recording the shadow on a holographic link screen as he stood in the stairway.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In a moment, the shadow was on top of Sylzar. His foot failed to meet solid ground beneath him and he fell forward. Astrius, standing in the newly spawned stairway, turned back.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Sylzar\u2019s face became a tangle of sharp black shapes. His screams were pausing and unpausing like a corrupted recording. Polygons on his arms and shoulders were jittering, revealing the void beneath. His eyes were black and pleading.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Astrius reached out to him, unthinking.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Kaluthax grabbed Astrius\u2019 arm. \u201cThere\u2019s no time!\u201d he said. The wall he had removed reappeared in front of them. The two of them descended the stairs in a mad dash.<br><br><hr><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;More stairs spawned in front of them as they ran until Kaluthax made it level out into a square room and despawned the path behind them. The floor of the space was the familiar rough stone of the dungeon, but the walls were untextured grey. Kaluthax summoned an armchair and collapsed into it. They reached out into the Downlink and got back a wave of heaving nausea, concentrated on his left hip.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cHow\u2019s Sylzar doing?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Astrius stood, leaning on his staff, to the side of the unfurnished space. His daemons cowered by his feet.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Kaluthax ran a search of the Downlink, using a limited interface this time to avoid whatever that sensation was. A search for Sylzar\u2019s ID came back blank. He wasn\u2019t waiting to respawn, he wasn\u2019t at the dungeon\u2019s post-game stats room. He wasn\u2019t anywhere.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cI cannot find him.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cWhat do you mean you can\u2019t find him? He has to be somewhere.\u201d Astrius began to pace. His footsteps did not echo.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Kaluthax opened his mouth, then closed it again. \u201cMaybe it is because he is inside the error.\u201d he said cautiously.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Astrius made a gesture near his temple, which Kaluthax interrupted with an ethereal hand. \u201cDon\u2019t connect to the Downlink!\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cI think we\u2019re past dungeon immersion.\u201d Astrius batted the spectre out of the way.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cIt is not that, the whole network is-\u201d Kaluthax put some weight on his left hip to see if the pain was still there. It was. \u201c-bugged. Allow me.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Kaluthax spawned a camera in the dungeon\u2019s entrance and projected the image at a wall. The dungeon\u2019s ominous archway was stuttering and sliding. A response team fresh from the Stack was clutching their sides and shouting. The two of them stared at the spectacle.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cWe have two options,\u201d said Kaluthax. \u201cWe can hide out down here - I don\u2019t think it will find us - and hope the Stack can deal with it before it spreads. Or, we can go up and try to finish it off ourselves.\u201d They turned towards Astrius \u201cAnd rescue Sylzar, of course.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Astrius looked at the Stack squad. They were trying to create a clean concrete hallway into the noise, but it turned into distortion as fast as they could spawn it. The jet-black shadows were spreading into the spine, entering other dungeons.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cIt looks like we have to fight\u201d<br><br><hr><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It had been a long time since Kaluthax had seen their dungeon from this angle. From inside the palace, the walls loomed and the halls lurked. They had designed it to be unsettling, but found themself unsettled nonetheless. They nearly walked into a spike trap\u2019s blind spot without checking before catching themself. This wasn\u2019t just their dungeon anymore.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cYou were fighting it for a bit without me. What did you see?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Astrius jumped at Kaluthax breaking the silence. \u201cIt came out of the entrance, the way we came in. It was big. It jumped around the sides of the room.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In the grim entryway leading to the king\u2019s chamber, the stone glitched and spun around a nearby epicentre. Kaluthax summoned a skeletal minion. It stumbled forward into the noise and dissolved into glitchy darkness.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cLight\u201d, they said.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cYes?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cIt must be the light - or rather, the shadow shader. Something about it went haywire and turned into this somehow.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Astrius cast a light spell at the distortion. It dispelled the darkness for a moment before refracting out into spinning grey patterns. \u201cCan you turn the shader off?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Kaluthax tried. \u201cNope. Figures.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cPlan A, then?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cPlan A\u201d<br><br><hr><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As they entered the king\u2019s chamber, the automated final boss music cycle faded in. The error was a pillar of black, jagged shapes with a humanoid form barely visible within. The room\u2019s walls were long gone, leaving shards of floor floating in an expanse of stranded assets. It didn\u2019t turn toward them as they assumed their battle formation.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It didn\u2019t move. It was just upon them. Kaluthax threw Astrius aside in a burst of force as the error engulfed their torso. Pain, real pain like they hadn\u2019t felt in millennia, flowed through them. They selected a column hovering in midair a few meters away. It flew towards them, slamming into the error and sending it and Kaluthax sprawling. Kaluthax felt his bones crunch. He didn\u2019t bother trying to stand.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cGo for it!\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Astrius had landed wedged in a bit of floor that had lost its hitbox. He planted one forearm on solid ground and waved his staff with the other. His daemons materialized and charged the error. The daemons became an array of shimmering lights, locking around it. The error struggled.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cGot it!\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Kaluthax entered a simple command. Every polygon in the whole dungeon blinked out of existence. They fell. Astrius fell. Far above them, a monument to the Fool King fell. The error began to slip its bonds.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The monument collided with the error with a shuddering crunch. With no surfaces for shadows to be cast on, it spasmed out in every direction like a firework. Its scream was an ascending screech of static. The sound faded into silence as they continued to fall. After what felt like a safe duration, Kaluthax slowed both of their descent and summoned a transparent surface beneath them.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They cut the music.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cWell?\u201d said Astrius.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cWell what? We did it!\u201d Kaluthax laughed. \u201cWe did it!\u201d His bony jaw clattered.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cSo where\u2019s Sylzar?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Kaluthax stopped laughing.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They searched the screaming Downlink. The Weft was down a user.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cI am sorry\u201d, they said. \u201cI think he is dead. Really, actually, dead.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;No one had died in the Weft for the last sixty-one hundred years.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Astrius waved away his daemonmancer robes for a comfortable white jumpsuit. He sat down and began to cry. \u201cI guess I suspected as much.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Kaluthax searched their extensive repository of headstones, sarcophagi, coffins, and monuments. None of them felt appropriate for the circumstances. They summoned a blank block of stone and began to carve.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cWhat was Sylzar-\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cHamsterMan.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cRight, uh, what was\u2026 HamsterMan like?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Astrius laid down on his back. \u201cHe could be a real pain sometimes. He used to work with me in Element. Then he realized he hated it. Went to the Heap to be a dungeon delver. This was actually the first time I\u2019d met him in years.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Kaluthax didn\u2019t know how to carve that. They found HamsterMan\u2019s most recent avatar, converted it to a stone texture, and put it on a simple plinth. It was a dashing space pirate, scimitar raised.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If there was a way a monument was supposed to feel, this didn\u2019t feel like it.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cHe was a great delver\u201d, said Kaluthax.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cI know\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Kaluthax lay down next to Astrius.

It consisted of annoyingly tiny islands which one had to travel between on twee custom portals, one hop at a time. Nu brushed some soot out of his fur. The last one had been fire dancing themed.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This particular portal took the form of a flaming raft zipping across the water, throwing up a steaming spray behind it. As he traveled, the sky faded from deep night to a pastel-hued sunset and the temperature picked up. Nu shifted out his skintight jumpsuit for something a bit looser.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;His current body of choice was an altered - a humanoid body with animal characteristics, in his case those of a predatory cat. His fur was sleek textured gray and his eyes were piercing. He thought the overall effect was modern and imposing.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He stared up into the middle distance. He was looking for juggling routines.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He found one, performed by one SomonSays 2400 years ago. It looked doable. He produced five tiny metal cubes from his sleeve. They unfolded in his hand, apertures sliding open to allow telescoping pillars to emerge and expand. Curved metal surfaces emerged from slots, rotated, and clicked into position. He was now holding five light metal spheres, their surfaces marked with cosmetic ridges, joints, and blinking lights. He began to juggle them.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hopefully SomonSays wasn\u2019t part of the troupe he was joining. That would be awkward.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The raft stuttered and jumped as the next island came into view. It was a small isle in soft colours with a spiraling path around a single mountain. The path was lined with palm trees that swayed in the breeze like stuffed toys.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The plank of the raft beneath Nu bucked and poofed into a plush facsimile of itself. Soon, so did the remainder of the raft and Nu\u2019s juggling balls. The sudden floatier behaviour made him drop the pattern. Now that the island was closer, he could see that every surface, from the rock faces of the mountain to the trees to the beach his raft was pulling into, was made of soft fabric. He felt a sneeze coming on. He tried to resist it, but the spasm overtook him, sproinging his body into a plush form. It kept its musculature as quilted patches, but the soft shading of his fur became a patchwork of contrasting colours and his lionish face was replaced by the placid smile of a cartoon cat. The raft jolted to a stop, spilling him onto the beach.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A lavender-coloured stuffed bear with a big red spot sewn into its face leapt out at him from behind a denim fern.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cWelcome to Gemi\u2019s Isle!\u201d it said. A burst of confetti appeared from nowhere and vanished before it could hit the ground.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cGemi\u2019s Isle is a funtastic experience! - there\u2019s puzzles, games, and a whole island to explore as you make your way to the peak! If you get all the way to the end, you can add your plush self to the island as a character!\u201d The bear gestured at a platform suspended from one of the swaying trees, where a few stuffed animals waved back. It looked like it could hold quite a few more.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cThank you,\u201d said Nu. He pulled his avatar from a downlink backup and reloaded it. It plushified immediately. \u201cBut I\u2019m in a bit of a rush and just need to find a way to the next island.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The bear pouted. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to do the whole island, how about doing the first part? Then you\u2019ll be at the docks on the back of the island, and you can leave from there.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Nu walked past the bear. It scampered to get back in front of him.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cThe first challenge is a scavenger hunt! The path to the next section is blocked by a door that can only be unlocked by putting in the 9 puzzle pieces scattered all over this beach. You\u2019ll have to\u2026\u201d The bear, not watching where it was going, walked into a tree and bounced backwards.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Nu was climbing the wall on which the puzzle door was inset. He had managed to get his claws, at least, back to normal. The sandy stone wall was a rough burlap that was no problem to climb. He threw himself over the top and hit an invisible wall. He was thrown back and landed sprawled on the beach.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The bear stood over him. \u201cNice try, mister! You\u2019ll need to climb to get one of the pieces, but not that way. Try going\u2026\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Nu pointed a palm at the bear. It melted like hot plastic. Steam and oil wicked off it as it deflated. Soon, all that remained was a marbled puddle.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The island was quiet for a moment.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cWhat the hell is your problem?\u201d A different voice came from behind one of the burlap walls. A zipper materialized on its surface and zipped out a rough doorway, and a user stepped through. She was another altered - doglike rather than catlike, more feminine and wearing a tropical dress patterned like splattered paint. \u201cYou come to my island, the least you could do is play along a bit.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cThe daemon was bothering me,\u201d said Nu.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cYou could have just told it that,\u201d said Gemi. \u201cThat hurt.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cYou hooked a daemon\u2019s senses up to your mind and let it walk around? How does that even work?\u201d Nu stared off into space for a moment. \u201cAnyways, as I told your daemon, I\u2019m in a bit of a rush.\u201d He moved to walk towards the puzzle door again, but Gemi stood in his way.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cHow could you be in a rush? Whatever you\u2019re going to, it\u2019ll be here tomorrow, or next year if you need it to. In the Buffer,\u201d she stated, \u201cWe take our time.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cIt\u2019s a juggling troupe, and I said I\u2019d be there for a limited time, which begins soon. So, if you\u2019ll excuse me...\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cHeading through here, that must be the Seven Cycles. They perform every week. You can take in the sights, you know. Who knows, maybe you can try out your routine for me. I\u2019d like to see it.\u201d She did not look like she wanted to see it.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cHaven\u2019t really decided on a routine yet,\u201d said Nu. \u201cI\u2019ll look up something on the way there.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Gemi sputtered. \u201cWhat is the point of joining the Seven Cycles if you don\u2019t even have a routine you want to do?\u201d She glared at Nu. \u201cWait, do you mean you\u2019re just going to copy something? I\u2019ll tell them! I\u2019m pretty sure you can\u2019t do that.\u201d She jabbed a finger into his face. It went clean through.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The hologram that was standing where Nu once stood fizzled and failed. Gemi turned around and saw the hole Nu had melted through the puzzle door. Through the hole she could see Nu, fully back in his normal form. He was skipping up the steps to the velvet portal that would take him to the next island.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Gemi growled. The beach reared up around Nu and tried to buck him away. He fell back, but a silver gadget extended from his wrist to grap the portal\u2019s edge. It yanked him forward, and he was through.<br><br><hr><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There was a sound like a dying scream.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Without warning, a wave of static and pain washed over the isle. In its wake, the sky blinked and fizzled out. Textured fabric faded, revealing the bare polygons beneath.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;All over the Weft, lights were going out.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Nu reached into the Downlink to steady himself and got back nothing but static and fear. The velvet portal shorted, squeezed, and blacked out, throwing him back onto the shore. The pain was everywhere, but his left hip especially felt like it was tearing apart.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Gemi forced her eyes open and found herself lying face down on the ground. She rolled over. Every daemon and automated spectator was clutching their left side. Even the trees and stones were doubled over and shivering.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Gemi closed her eyes again. She opened herself to the Downlink gradually. In the sea of grief she could make out other users. She could feel the tragic sensation reflecting and amplifying off of them. She tried to clear her mind.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cDon\u2019t just lie there!\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Her eyes snapped open again. Nu had managed to find his feet and was swaying over to her. He gestured in the general direction of the island\u2019s central mountain. It was slumping in on itself, having come loose from the isle\u2019s custom floaty physics and become subject to the physical weight of a structure made of cloth ten stories high.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Gemi didn\u2019t bother trying to stand up. She pulled herself to him hand over hand. Nu threw some tiny metal cubes on the ground. They unfolded and merged into a metal shield that enclosed around them. The last panel clicked into place just as the collapsing cloth hit it. The shield squealed and strained under the weight.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cThis is an excessive way of keeping me here,\u201d he said.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cYou think I did this?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cIs there anyone else here?\u201d The shield sagged down a few centimeters.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cIt\u2019s the Downlink. Something bad happened out there.\u201d Another mountainous fold of cloth landed on the pile above them, making rivets pop under the increased weight.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cThen cut us off!\u201d Nu banged on the shield, putting up a central strut for more strength.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cI was working on it!\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Gemi focused. The whole island faded out of existence, leaving the two of them floating a few meters off the ground. Beneath them was a circular disk of untextured black material, just barely above the waterline. Nu managed to signal the shield to retract into itself as they fell. They hit the ground hard. Metal cubes clattered around them.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The pain cut out, leaving a gasping afterburn. They both collapsed onto their backs.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The sky was scattered with stars. There was nothing around them but deep black sea.<br><br><hr><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Gemi staggered to her feet. Her left hip still burned with phantom pain, but it was fading. Under the dim starlight, it was hard to tell for certain, but it seemed like no physical injuries remained. She began to walk around the island\u2019s edge, tracing a scalloped pattern with her foot. Where she touched the black surface, green felt bloomed. It was relaxing work.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d asked Nu. He was still lying on his back.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cRebuilding the island,\u201d said Gemi. She had the outline now. She conjured a bus-sized  block of upholstery foam and began to carve it into a rough mound shape.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for you to have every asset stored locally. You won\u2019t be able to finish rebuilding without downlink access.\u201d said Nu.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Gemi finished up the hill and turned to the location where a mountainous ridge should be. \u201cWould you like to help, or are you just going to lie there?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Nu didn\u2019t respond. He wasn\u2019t lying in the centre of the island anymore. He was standing at the edge, staring down into the water. Waves lapped at his feet.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cThere\u2019s something down there,\u201d he said.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Gemi joined him. Deep in the water was a huge skeletal serpent that glowed green. Jets of boiling steam and sudden icicles clouded the water as it passed.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It was heading towards them.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cMust be an error. The Stack\u2019s had an advisory out for them since that racing incident.\u201d He crossed his arms. \u201cWe should do something about that,\u201d said Nu. \u201cI\u2019ll build a weapons platform.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cYou have an island-sized weapons platform model just lying around in your local cache?\u201d said Gemi. The wind picked up as the error approached, picking up loose blocks of foam and carrying them out to sea.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cI\u2019ll figure something out. I build stuff like this all the time.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Nu traced out a large rectangle covering most of the island. Metal plates covered in knobs and ridges emerged from the island\u2019s surface, clicking into place to form the first few layers of a seamless pyramid.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cHow big is this thing going to be?\u201d said Gemi. The island sagged and dipped under the weight of the erupting metal.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The foundation leveled off with a flat surface, which Nu began to dot with struts. \u201cPretty big? It\u2019s going to get one shot off maximum, so it\u2019s got to have some power behind it. One big harpoon. Kind of an arbalest.\u201d He wasn\u2019t looking at Gemi, instead inspecting the assembly of a massive hinge. \u201cIf you want to make yourself useful, get me some shock absorbers on the base.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Gemi folded her arms. \u201cI don\u2019t think any shock absorbers in the world are going to help here. This base was built for vacation homes, not superweapons.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Nu ignored her. He was laying out the compound springs that would power the weapon. As the error approached the island, the sea became choppy. Sudden spikes of pressure and temperature created bursting splashes of water that fell as harsh rain.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Nu aimed the arbalest down into the water. The harpoon in its chamber was nearly the length of the island. The ratchets clicked as the springs built up force. The error wasn\u2019t visible behind the froth and spray of the water\u2019s surface. Any moment now.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He fired. The whole island reared back with the recoil, tilting the aim up. The harpoon skipped along the surface of the water like a stone.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The error collided with the underside of the island. It tilted over 30, 40 degrees, plunging half of the disk\u2019s surface into the water.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cJump down here!\u201d said Gemi. Nu looked down. She had summoned one of her fabric trees and bent it down as a cartoonish catapult. She was sitting on the canopy, lashed down with rope. Nu landed on top of her. The ropes gave, and the contraption flung the two of them out to sea.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They hit the water hard. It was turbulent and murky. In patches it was freezing cold and burning hot. Chaotic waves submerged them. Nu managed to get a hold of Gemi and summon another shield around the two of them. This one was a shell fully enclosing them. In the tumult of the water, it came out lopsided and egg-shaped. Gemi had to duck her head to avoid getting it cut off as the last panels closed.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The waves tossed the makeshift craft around, spinning and rolling it. They crashed and tangled into each other. Gemi flailed and managed to get her hand on one side of the egg. On its exterior, buoyant balloons puffed into place. The egg still rocked in the current, but now one side stayed up.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The interior of the egg was cramped and inconveniently round. Water pooled at the bottom. Meaningless blinking lights on the walls barely illuminated Gemi and Nu\u2019s wet fur. Waves breaking against the hull could be heard as deep thuds. They couldn\u2019t see the outside at all.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me the island was just a floating disk?\u201d shouted Nu. His voice echoed in the enclosed space, fading out into a metallic buzz. He tried to turn his back to Gemi but the space was too small to do anything but sit in the pool of water right next to her.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They sat and listened. They could hear the error appraching, causing points on the metal to develop patches of ice or glow red-hot. They shifted in their seats, trying to avoid those spots. The metal creaked as the thermal expansion strained it.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The error passed, and the effect faded. The air inside the egg was beginning to feel a bit muggy.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cWouldn\u2019t have worked anyways,\u201d said Nu. \u201cToo much recoil. Couldn\u2019t really aim well. Who knows how the projectile would have reacted with the water\u2019s surface.\u201d He rubbed his hand over a section of the egg that had sprung a small leak, mending it.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cI could have explained myself better,\u201d grumbled Gemi. The egg was beginning to tilt a little in the water. \u201cNot like anything I was doing was going to solve anything.\u201d On instinct, she almost reached out into the Downlink to escape the conversation, then caught herself.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cI suppose we should try to kill it again,\u201d she said.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Nu transitioned from a sitting position to a squat so he could rest a hand on the egg\u2019s upper surface.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cThis is almost certainly not going to work,\u201d he said.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cI know.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The top of the egg whirred back, revealing the stormy sky.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Gemi stretched to her feet and nearly capsized their craft. She gestured out, and puffy pillows of light pink and purple spread out from the egg like the petals of a flower, creating a wide floating platform.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Nu staggered out of the metal shell and onto the fabric. He gasped for fresh air. \u201cLeave some holes,\u201d he shouted at Gemi. \u201cI\u2019ll plant sensors going down into the water.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cGot it,\u201d said Gemi. \u201cLook for the dark red petals; I\u2019ll put a hole through them.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They yelled back and forth as they worked. The flower soon had high metal walls to keep out the sea spray and a low fabric hull to keep it stable against the waves.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The rain became scalding hot and then switched to hail. Nu laid a hand on the flower\u2019s surface. \u201cThe error\u2019s coming.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cWhich way?\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Nu pointed down and slightly to the left. He shifted his arms slightly, tracking the error. This wasn\u2019t working.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cJust - follow my wire.\u201d<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A metal strand shot out from beneath the flower. Gemi felt its weight, its passing. She cast her sensation out to it. She willed it to sprout heavy cushioning foam like grapes from a vine. Nu led more sensors out through the padding. The top of the strand weaved through the water.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cBrace!\u201d shouted Nu.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The error hit them hard. The flower bucked and lifted a few meters out of the water. The foam freezed, burned, and compressed under the strain. Gemi and Nu snapped out of their trance and rolled across the cushioned surface.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They were still afloat.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The sea around them sputtered vindictively. Needle-thin spires of water appeared on the surface, stretching up to infinity before crashing down as booming waterfalls of mist. Gemi and Nu huddled under the flower\u2019s wall. Gemi gestured behind them, unable to be heard over the din.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They immersed their sensation in the material again.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Gemi sprouted pressurized balloons from the island on one side, forming a honeycomb curtain. Nu\u2019s curious metal followed them, adding a solid hexagonal truss for them to anchor to. A central fin descended from the flower. Air tanks, hydrodynamic surfaces, and trigger wires climbed and flowered around it.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The error drew close. All the wires and seams held their breath.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;By wordless agreement they held on until the last moment. They exhaled. The balloons popped. Propellers spun up and air tanks released. The flower reared up and jetted forward a distance of twice its length. It glid forward on a streamlined hull, now more the shape of a tubby boat.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The error breached the water\u2019s surface where they had been a moment ago.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It hovered in the air, held aloft by spasms of thrust that rattled through its skeletal frame. Pockets of air around it hollowed out to vacuum and rolled over into ultra-high pressures, distorting light and emitting percussive bangs. It turned towards them and sagged down into the water.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It jerked towards them. Nu snapped tightly wound metal and joints into the hull. It waved and flexed, propelling them forward and around. The storm turned to heavy sleet, weighing down the vessel. Gemi wove a watertight dome over their heads.  She added elongated fins behind the hull, giving it the form of a fish\u2019s tail. They pushed their way around the error, dancing, learning its movements.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It pursued them. Nu added a long spine down their tail, extending it into a more streamlined shape. They were a curious fish, bulbous domed head propelled by a graceful tail. They wouldn\u2019t be able to outrun it forever.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They turned to face the eror. Two giant arms sprouted from their sides, interlocking steel and rope forming musculature and nerves. One arm blossomed into a shield. The other unfolded into a sword. When the error next approached, they did not dodge but caught the blow head on, batting it back with a mighty swing. The error sank deep into the sea.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They reared up on their tail. Their torso extended up, forming proper shoulders and an impassive carnivorous head. They plunged forward into the water and dove.<br><br><hr><br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They were a mermaid four stories in length. Iridescent patches of waterproof fabric formed over joints. He was the pistons that drove the tail back and forth. She was the plumes that guided and smoothed the thrust. He was the glow in their eyes that illuminated the error ahead of them. She was the bellows that reduced their buoyancy and pulled them deeper. They were catching up to it.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Overflow Sea had no bottom they could detect. There was no light but for the glow of their eyes and the flashes of superheated water around the error. The sword in their hand retracted and folded around itself, becoming a harpoon nearly as tall as they were. Blue tracing lights glimmered on its point. He was the tip of the spear and she the arm that moved it. The harpoon sliced through the water, trailing a cable of braided metal and fibre.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The point intersected the error for a moment. It inflated, lodging inside the error\u2019s ribcage. The cable stretched and pulled them forward. They climbed towards the error hand over hand.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They were close enough now to feel the pressure buckle and underflow in the error\u2019s presence. One hand became a shield, blossoming out into a canopy while still grasping the cable in front of them. One hand became a spinning wheel, pulling strands from their shoulder and shooting them forward. Wire and ribbon tangled around the error. Some snapped and drifted down into the deep, but more replaced them. The error was soon wrapped in a cocoon of tension.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They played with their prey. Cables could steer it and fins could guide it. They pulled up. They could feel the speed and the impacts trailing behind them. A precise yank made them corkscrew around. One hand extended out, trailing through the water. They could see the shine of the surface now.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They breached. They cleared the waves by several stories. The error flopped and struggled in midair ahead of them. They pulled themselves forward along the cable in a fluid motion. They grabbed the error with both hands. Tendrils of metal shot through it. Pressure tanks and balloons sprouted within its ribs. As they hit the water, they pirouetted, cut the cables, and threw the error skyward. There was a glorious bang.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Fragments of bone rained down upon the Overflow Sea.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They splashed and danced as the storm faded. He was the keen eyes that could sense the black disk that was once Gemi\u2019s Isle, floating in the waves. She was the gentle touch that righted it. The mermaid, nearly as big as the island that once stood here, curled around the disk\u2019s edge. They grabbed it and held it fast.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The mermaid\u2019s chest opened and Gemi and Nu walked out.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They walked across the disk hand in hand. They stepped over rivers of runoff from the mermaid\u2019s soaked fabric. At the centre, Gemi raised a grassy mound and reclined on it. The air was humid and warm. Somewhere far away, a bird sang.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She painted the sky with a swirling galaxy.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Nu laid down next to her. \u201cNo pastels this time?\u201d he asked.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cI\u2019m going for something a bit more adventurous,\u201d she said. Columns of fog descended from above. They split up the skyline and spilled across the water. Misty light spilled from them.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Nu sat up. \u201cI suppose I should help,\u201d he said. Mechanical pyramids rose across the isle, dotted with hovering orbs of light. One appeared right in front of them. Around it spun rings that matched the galaxy skybox far above.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cDon\u2019t you have somewhere to be?,\u201d said Gemi. She pulled in close and watched him work.<br><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u201cThey\u2019ll wait.\u201d<br>", "story_title": "Weft Trace 03: The Cachemates"}, {"card_name": "Olis Mars, Final Archivist", "color": "UR", "rarity": "rare", "type": "Legendary Creature \u2013 Human Wizard", "number": 208, "color_identity": "UR", "cost": "{1}{U}{R}", "rules_text": "Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell from your hand, cache it instead of putting it into your graveyard as it resolves.
